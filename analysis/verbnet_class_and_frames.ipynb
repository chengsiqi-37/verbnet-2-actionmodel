    "VerbNet encodes a hierarchical structure where a class can contain one or more subclasses. In the annotation, subclasses appear at least twice within the resource: (i) as standalone entries and (ii) as references in their parentâ€™s `subclasses` field. The deeper a subclass is nested, the more frequently it will appear in the records of its ancestors. Therefore, a straightforward method to obtain all unique class entries in VerbNet is to count only the top level entries, disregarding the subclass annotations.\n",
